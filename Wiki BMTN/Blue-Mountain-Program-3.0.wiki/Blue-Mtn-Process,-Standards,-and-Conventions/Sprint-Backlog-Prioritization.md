# Metrics to Determine Priority â€“ The SAFe Way

## This is to be used as an aid in prioritization, rather than a policy

## User-Business Value

-   0 Point: Zero Business Impact
-   1 Points: Low Business Impact
-   2 Points: Moderate to High Business Impact
-   3 Points: Very High to the Highest Business Impact

## Time Criticality

-   0 Point: Not time critical
-   1 Points: Can wait until next increment planning
-   2 Points: Moderate urgency, needs to be planned within next 2-3 sprints
-   3 Points: It has the highest urgency and must be planned for within 1 sprint

## Risk Reduction

-   0 Point: Zero risk
-   1 Points: Low risk
-   2 Points: Moderate to Moderate-High risk
-   3 Points: Very high and/or will trigger a disaster

## Job Effort

-   0 Point: Zero effort of your sprint
-   1 Points: 1/4 the effort of your sprint
-   2 Points: Half of your sprint
-   3 Points: Could take 1-2 or more iterations

# Priority Criteria

## Priority 1 Score: 10-12 Points

-   Items that need to be focused on this Program Increment
-   Tie Breakers:
    -   Infrastructure Items
    -   Anything to do with Hamster (to include Above Baseline Software)
    -   Wallaby
    -   Gates Edge for Cedar

## Priority 2 Score: 7-9 Points

-   Items added to a sprint only after priority 1 is assigned and team capacity remains
-   Defaults:
    -   Gates Edge except for Cedar
    -   Above Baseline Software for all animals other than Hamster

## Priority 3 Score: 4-6 Points

-   Epics that need prioritization but are not more important than Priorities 1 & 2

## Priority 4 Score: 0-3 Points

-   4 = Not a Priority
-   New Requirements default to Priority 4 and prioritized at the next IP Sprint
-   Could be further on the roadmap
-   Parity items that will need to be integrated later
