# Feature Approval Process

Approval of epics are done by leadership (JP & Theresa) once they go through the RDV process.

Features are approved by the leadership of the different work streams (scrum team product owners).

Tags will be used to manage the approval of features. A tag should be added when a feature is created and another tag will be used once the feature has been approved by the scrum team product owner.

Use the following tags:

Tags

-   “Review” – Use the review tag for nominating features for approval. This tag will be used for the Scrum Team Product Owner to validate and approve the new feature.
-   “Approved” – Once the feature is approved by the Product Owner, the review tag should be removed and the approved tag should be added.
