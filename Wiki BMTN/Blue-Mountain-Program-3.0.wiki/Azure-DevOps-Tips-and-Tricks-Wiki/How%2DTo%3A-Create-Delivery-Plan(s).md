# How-To: Create Delivery Plan(s)

This is a quick guide for how to create a delivery plan. The steps provided here are Feature-Centric. While Delivery Plans can be built using other Work Item types, this walkthrough is limited to using Features only.

## Feature Formatting

For each feature that needs to be included in the Delivery Plan it must:
* Be Tagged with a common label to be used in the Delivery Plan criteria
* Have a Start Date - That forecasts when work on its PBIs will begin
* Have a Target Date - That forecasts when work on its PBIs will be complete

For Example, to create a Delivery Plan for the Scrum of Scrums:
